## Question
p and q are two points chosen at random between 0 & 1. What is the probability that the ratio p/q lies between 1 & 2?

## Hint
Graph Shading. (Whenever we see two uniform random variables, we graph them up!)

## Answer


## Solution
Assume that the points are x & y. Create x-y graph, and our desired region is the area between lines y=x & y=2x. This region is 1/4th of the rest.

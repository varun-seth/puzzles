## Question
$x$ & $y$ are two random points selected uniformly between $0$ & $1$. Using them, create a point uniformly random in circle of radius $1$. (uniform means that the probability density is constant)

## Hint
Let  $r=\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}$; the point $(x/r, y/r)$ is not uniformly distributed on the disk.

## Answer
 $\theta = 2 \pi x$ and $r = \sqrt{y}$, then take the point as $(r \cos(\theta),r \sin(\theta))$

## Solution
 The idea is that the probability of a point to be between $r$ and $(r+ d r)$ is $2 \pi \cdot r \cdot d r$. Hence to choose a radius we need to generate a number from random number generator which follows the probability distribution $2 \cdot r$.

 To generate a random number which follows above probability from a uniform distribution we simply take the square root of the number generated by uniform distribution. Hence, $\theta = 2 \pi x$ and $r = \sqrt{y}$, then take the point as $(r \cos(\theta),r \sin(\theta))$

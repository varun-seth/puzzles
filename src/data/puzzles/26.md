## Question
In a dark room, there is a deck of 52 cards, with exactly 10 cards facing up, rest are facing down. You can touch the cards with your hands but cannot sense which cards are facing up/down. You need to split all these cards into two decks with equal number of cards facing up!

## Hint
We never said that both the final decks must have 5 cards each facing up.

## Answer
Create a deck of 10 cards randomly from the original 52-card deck. And then turn over the 10-card deck.


## Solution
This puzzle involves a trick, i.e, we can manually flip over any number of cards.

We create a deck of $k=10$ cards randomly selected from the deck.

Suppose the $k$-card deck included $x$ number of cards that were originally facing up, and $k-x$ cards are facing up in the other deck.

By flipping over this $k$-card deck, now there are exactly $k-x$ cards facing up in this deck, same as the other deck.

This question can be solved regardless of the original number $k=10$, as long as we know the count of cards facing up.

## Question
In a dark room, there is a deck of 52 cards, with exactly 10 cards facing up, rest facing down. You need to split this into two decks with equal number of cards facing up!

## Hint
The question can be solved even when up facing cards are 11. The split decks need not have equal number of up-facing cards.


## Answer


## Solution
Create a deck of k cards randomly from the original 52-card deck, (k=10 here) and then turn over the k-card deck. Goal is achieved!

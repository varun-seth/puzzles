## Question
There is a regular die and a special invisible die. You know that regular die has integers 1 to 6, but don't know what's on the invisible dice. After tossing, I speak the sum of outcome of both die. It so happens that the outcome is an interger between 1 to 12, with equal probability (1/12 each). Can you guess what are the numbers printed on special invisible dice?


## Hint
For the sum to be 1, we need atleast 0, and for sum to be 12, what do we need? Can you guess the digits of invisible dice now?

## Answer
 0 0 0 6 6 6

## Solution
Faces of cube have numbers: 0 0 0 6 6 6 . If we compute conditional probability, we get 0 with probabilty (1/2) and 6 with probability (1/2). Hence the sum is 1,2....12 with probability of (1/12) each

## Question
The probability of accidents on a road in one hour is $3/4$. What is the probability of accidents in half hour?

## Hint
The joint probability of no events in two intervals of half-hours is the same as the probability of no event in one hour.

## Answer
1/2

## Solution

Probability of no accident in $1$ hour = P(no accidents in the first half hour ) * P(no accidents in the next half hour)

$\implies 1 - 3/4 =p^2 \implies p=1/2$

Hence the probability of an accident in half an hour $=1 - 1/2 = 1/2$

For those who are more inclined towards the inner wirings

Assume that the disjoint time intervals are independent, the probability of no accidents in $[0, 2t)$ = the probability of no accidents in $[0,t)$ AND $[t,2t)$ 

Define $p(t)$ = probability of an accident in an interval of $t$ hours

$\implies 1-p(2t) = (1-p(t)) \cdot (1-p(2t - t)) = (1 - p(t))^2$

Given that $p(1h)=3/4 \implies p(0.5h)=1/2$ and $p(2h)=15/16$.

The way we have defined $p(t)$ above, it is the probability that at least $1$ accident happens in time interval $t$. Thus, as $t$ increases, $p(t)$ also increases.

The assumption for the independence of disjoint intervals is called [Memorylessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness)

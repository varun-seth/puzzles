## Question
Assume 100 zombies are walking on a straight line, all moving with the same speed. Some are moving towards left, and some towards right. If a collision occurs between two zombies, they both reverse their direction. Initially all zombies are standing at 1 unit intervals. For every zombie, you can see whether it moves left or right, can you predict the number of collisions?

## Hint
On every collision, assume that the two zombies don't reverse direction but simply cross each other.

## Answer
undefined

## Solution
Since we can assume that zombies can pass through each other, for a zombie moving right, count the number of zombies to its right moving left. Add this number for every right moving zombie. That is the number of collisions.

## Question
In this gambling game, a player can buy a ticket for Rs 1 on any number from 1 to 6. Three identical and unfair dice are rolled. If the booked number appears on 0, 1, 2 or 3 dice, player wins Rs 0, 1, 2 or 3 respectively, without returning the original Rs 1. What is expected money you can win after buying a ticket for Rs 1?

## Hint
Book the full house

## Answer
1/2

## Solution
We bet Rs 1 on each number 1-6. In any case, we get Rs 3 back. That is 1/2 per ticket. Hence the expected amount of money we can win is 1/2. A tedious way to arrive at this answer is to calculate the probability of getting 1, 2 or 3 faces common to our booking.

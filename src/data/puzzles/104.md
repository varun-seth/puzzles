## Question
A. B & C live together and share everything equally. One day A brings home 5 logs of wood, B brings 3 logs and C brings none. Then they use the wood to cook together and share the food. Since C did not bring any wood, he gives \$8 instead. How much to A and how much to B?

## Hint
Its not 5 & 3

## Answer


## Solution
Since each person consumed 8/3 woods. A gave 5-8/3 = 7/3 woods to C and B gave 3-8/3 = 1/3 woods to C.
So, Out of the 8 dollars, A gets 7 and B gets 1

## Question
A traveler meets a pair of twins at a fork in the road: one path is correct and one incorrect. One of the twins always tells the truth (knight), and the other one always lies (knave). Which single question can the traveler ask one of the twins to determine the correct path?



## Hint
Ask one twin about the other twin's knowledge!

## Answer


## Solution
This can be constructed in many ways.

1. The traveler can ask, "Would the other twin agree that the road on the **left** is correct?" The answer is guaranteed to be 'Yes' if and only if the road on the **right** is correct.

2. The traveler can also ask, "If I were to ask you whether the road on the **right** is correct, would you say 'Yes'?", both the twins tell yes only if the **right** path is indeed correct.

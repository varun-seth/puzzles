## Question
A father claims about snowfall last night. First daughter tells that the probability of snowfall on a particular night is 1/8. Second daughter tells that 5 out of 6 times the father is lying! What is the probability that there actually was a snowfall?

## Hint
Conditional Probability or Baye's Theorem

## Answer


## Solution
Let S = Snowfall occurred, and C = Claim

 Probability of (Snowfall given Claim) = $P(S | C) = \frac{P(C|S)*P(S)}{P(C)}$

 $P(C|S) = 1/6$,  $P(S) = 1/8$

 $P(C)$ = P(true claim) + P(False Claim) = $P(C|S)*P(S)$ + $P($ false claim | no snow) * P(no snow)

 This is same as $[1/6*1/8]/[ 1/6*1/8 + 7/8*5/6] = 1/36$

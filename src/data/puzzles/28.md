## Question
A father claims about snowfall last night. First daughter tells that the probability of snowfall on a particular night is 1/8. Second daughter tells that 5 out of 6 times the father is lying! What is the probability that there actually was a snowfall?

## Hint
Conditional Probability or Baye's Theorem

## Answer


## Solution
Let $S =$ Snowfall occurred, and $C =$ Claim

 Probability of (Snowfall given Claim) = $P(S | C) = \dfrac{P(C|S)*P(S)}{P(C)}$

 $P(C|S) = 1/6$,  $P(S) = 1/8$

 $P(C) = P(\text{True claim}) + P(\text{False Claim}) = (P(C|S)*P(S)) + P( \text{False claim} | \text{No snow}) * P(\text{No snow})$

 This is same as $[1/6*1/8]/[ 1/6*1/8 + 7/8*5/6] = 1/36$

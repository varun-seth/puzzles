## Question
Assuming that temperature varies continuously, prove that there are always two opposite points on the Earth's surface that have the same temperature.

## Hint
Consider the difference in temperature between two opposite points.

## Answer


## Solution
The motivation is that the temperature is a continuous function, and cannot keep increasing as we go around a circle.

Consider any great circle, like the Equator.

Suppose $t(\theta)$ is the temperature at the point $\theta$. 

Define $f(\theta) = t(\theta)-t(\theta+\pi)$

Note that $f(0)=t(0)-t(pi)$

$f(\pi)=t(\pi)-t(2 \pi) = t(pi)-t(0) = -f(0)$

Either both $f(0)$ and $f(\pi)$ are $0$ or one of them is positive and the other is negative.

Using [Mean Value Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem), $f(0)$ must be zero for some point between $0$ and $\pi$.

Thus, there will always be a pair of two opposite points at the same temperature.


There are an uncountably infinite number of such pairs.

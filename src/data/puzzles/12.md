## Question
Assuming that temperature varies continuously, prove that there are always two opposite points on the Earth's surface that have the same temperature.

## Hint


## Answer


## Solution
Aritro Pathak: consider any great circle.. T(x) is the temp at the point x .. let f(x)=T(x)-T(x+pi), then f(0)=T(0)-T(pi)..f(pi)=T(pi)-T(2pi)=T(pi)-T(0) then f(0) and f(pi) have different signs, so using mean value theorem, you have that f is 0 at some point.
 
FunFact: There are uncountable number of such pairs.

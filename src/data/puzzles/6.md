## Question
In a world where everyone wants a girl child, each family continues having babies till they have a girl. What do you think will the boy to girl ratio be eventually? (Assuming probability of having a boy or a girl is the same)

## Hint


## Answer
1:1

## Solution
Suppose there are N couples. First time, N/2 girls and N/2 boys are born (ignoring aberrations). N/2 couples retire, and rest half try another child. Next time, N/4 couples give birth to N/4 girls and rest N/4 boys. Thus, even in second iteration, ratio is 1:1. It can now be seen that this ratio always remain same, no matter how many times people try to give birth to a favored gender.

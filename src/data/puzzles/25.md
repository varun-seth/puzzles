## Question
Sheldon says "Suppose I have two children. Younger one is a girl". What is the probability that both children are girls?

"Forget all that, and suppose I have two children, and atleast one of them is a boy". Find probability of two boys.

"Suppose I have two kids, lets call them Bouba and Kiki", says Dr. Cooper, "and suppose Bouba is a girl !" What is the probability that I have two daughters?"

## Hint


## Answer
1/2, 1/3, 1/3

## Solution
First and second are un-ambiguous. Third is debatable as per the interpretation. I believed 1/3, as the names Cooper used were anonymous, and should have given no extra information. But it turns out that Cooper did provide some extra information. He had actually fixed a person (A). Also, calculating the probability in part 3 using conditionals will give 1/2.

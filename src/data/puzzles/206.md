## Question
A soda company is holding a contest where everyone who collects one each of N different coupons wins some prize. You get a coupon with each purchase of a soda, and each coupon is equally likely. Whatâ€™s the expected number of soda bottles you have to buy in order to collect all the coupons?

## Hint
Linearity of expectation

## Answer
undefined

## Solution
Divide the whole process in to stages. Each stage ends with collecting a coupon which is new ( different from the coupons we already have )

Let C_i be the random variable which denotes the number of coupons we buy in the stage i.

Let C be the random variable which denotes the number of coupons we buy in order to get all n coupons
Now,
C= C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n
Note C_1 = 1;
In general, while we are during stage i , we already have with us (i-1) different coupons. So, the probability of getting a new coupon is p_i = n-(i-1)/n. Also note that each C_i is a Geometrically distributed random variable with success probability equal to p_i. So, E(C_i) = 1/p_i = n/(n-i+1).
By using Linearity of Expectations,
E(C) = E(C_1) +E(C_2) + ...+E(C_n)
= n(1/n + 1/(n-1)+ ... +1)
~ nlogn.

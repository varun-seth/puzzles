## Question
What is the expected number of coin tosses required to get n consecutive heads?

## Hint
That sum wont work! Just find the recursive relation.

## Answer
En = 2Enâˆ’1 + 2, giving En = 2^(n+1)-2

## Solution
Define let Xn = number of tosses to get n consecutive heads; E(Xn) = expected number of coin tosses we require from now on, to get n consecutive heads. Recall the law of total probability,
E(Xn) = E ( E(Xn) |Y) )
where Y = current toss (either Head or tail).
En = (1/2)( E(Xn) | H) + (1/2)( E(Xn) | T)
En = (1/2)( E(X(n-1)) + 1 |H) + (1/2)( E(Xn) + 1 | T)
the extra 1 is because we just used a toss
En = 1 + (1/2)*E(n-1) + (1/2)*En
This above equation is logical and should be written directly.
=> En = 2E(n-1) + 2

This simplifies to 2^(n+1)-2 as E0 = 0. (not required)

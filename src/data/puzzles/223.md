## Question
A group of 5 people want to keep their secret document in a safe. They want to make sure that in future, only a majority (>=3) can open the safe. So they want to put some locks on the safe, each of the locks have to be opened to access the safe. Each lock can have multiple keys; but each key only opens one lock. How many locks are required at the minimum? How many keys will each member carry?

## Hint
For each group of 2 ppl, there must be a lock which none of them have a key to.

## Answer
10 locks, 6 Keys.

## Solution
For each group of 2 ppl, there must be a lock which none of them have a key to. But the key of such a lock will be given to the remaining 3 ppl of group. Thus, we must have atleast 5C2 = 10 Locks. Each lock has 3 keys, which is given to unique 3-member subgroup. So each member should have 10*3/5 = 6 keys.

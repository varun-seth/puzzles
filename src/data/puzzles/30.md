## Question
Two witches make a nightly visit to an all-night coffee shop. Each arrives at a random time between 0:00 and 1:00. Each one of them stays for exactly 30 minutes. On any one given night, what is the probability that the witches will meet at the coffee shop?

## Hint
Graph Shading

## Answer
3/4

## Solution
Plot the graph of X and Y, where X and Y denote the time each witch arrives. This will form a 60x60 square for total feasible region. The probability that they meet is |X-Y|<= 30. Draw this as favorable region, by joining line (30,0) with (60,30) and (0,30) with (30,60). Clearly the interior of this region has area 3/4 th of total. Hence the probability = 3/4 = 0.75

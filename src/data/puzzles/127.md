## Question
In a circle are light bulbs numbered 1 through n, all initially on. At time t, you examine bulb number t, and if it’s on, you change the state of bulb t + 1 (modulo n); i.e., you turn it off if it’s on, and on if it’s off. If bulb t is off, you do nothing. Prove that if you continue around and around the ring in this manner, eventually all the bulbs will again be on.

## Hint
It doesn't matter what the rules are, only thing that matters is that all bulbs should not go off!

## Answer
undefined

## Solution
Suppose every orientation of light bulbs & position of current pointer (t modulo n) forms a different state. Since all bulbs don’t go off, we must repeat a state after finite number of steps. Also notice that every state has a unique pre-state. Suppose the two states are at time T1 & T2. Notice that at time 0 all bulbs are on. Thus moving backwards from both states, we arrive at T2-T1, where all bulbs are on again.

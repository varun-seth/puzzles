## Question
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?". What is the probability to win car if you switch?

## Hint
undefined

## Answer
2/3

## Solution
Probability that your initial choice did not have car is 2/3. So you should switch to the other gate, and win the car with probability 2/3

## Question
1024 pirates stand in a circle. They start shooting alternately in a cycle such that the 1st pirate shoots the 2nd, the 3rd shoots the 4th and so on. The pirates who got shot are removed from the game. They continue in circles, shooting the next standing pirate, till only one pirate is left. Which position should someone stand to survive?

## Hint
1024 is a power of 2. Try to find a pattern using smaller powers of 2.

## Answer
1

## Solution
Let us define "round" as one complete circle of shootings.

Let's say $n = 2^k$. 

In the first round, all even-numbered people are shot, and only odd-numbered people survive. Note that $1^{\text{st}}$ person survives, and in total, $2^{k-1}$ people survive. In the second round, the $1^{\text{st}}$ starts shooting the same way, and the $2^{\text{nd}}$ person dies. Continuing this way, we see that the $1^{\text{st}}$ person always survives.

Hence, for $n = 1024$ (or any other power), the safe position is always the $1^{\text{st}}$ position.

### Trivia

1. This problem is called "Josephus problem", named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the $1^{\text{st}}$ century. Allegedly, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. Preferring suicide instead of being captured, they decided to form a circle and, kill every third soldier until none remained. Josephus, who preferred to surrender, managed to arrange the order of the soldiers in the circle so that he and another man were the last two survivors. At this point, they surrendered to the Romans rather than killing themselves.

2. If $n$ is not a power, then we can use a formula. Find the largest $m$ such that $2^m < n$. 

    Take $l = n-2^m$. 
    Then the safe position is $2 \cdot l + 1$. 

    For example, in the case of 100 pirates (the original puzzle), $N=100, 2^m=64, m=6, l = 36 \implies 2 \cdot l + 1 = 73$

    The formal proof for this formula can be found [here (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem#k.3D2).

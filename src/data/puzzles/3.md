## Question
An explorer walks 1 mile south, then 1 mile East and then 1 mile North. And reaches back to the starting point. The explorer shoots a bear, what color is the bear?

## Hint
Earth surface is curved, not flat.

## Answer
White

## Solution
North-pole satisfies this condition, where moving one mile to south, east and north brings you back to the same point. And a bear living in the north pole must be a polar bear, which is white in color.

But North pole is not the only point on Earth to satisfy this. How many such points are there? Consider this, if movement towards East (1 mile) was not there, then the explorer would have reached the starting point no matter what. But, since we are consider such an extreme case (north pole), let's take one more step. Imagine if 1 mile was the circumference of the circle, then the explorer would have reached the starting point by moving East.

Can this happen in real life - Yes!

We can imagine a ring of size 1 mile near the south pole, about $1/(2 \pi)$ miles away from it. The radius of this ring is such that the circumference will be exactly 1 mile. If the explorer could start from 1 mile north of this ring, then they would have reached the starting point after moving 1 mile south, 1 mile east (entire ring) and 1 mile north.

Hence, any point located at approximately $1 + 1/(2 \pi) $ miles away from the south pole satisfies the condition. Hence there are infinite such points, the locus is a ring near the south pole.

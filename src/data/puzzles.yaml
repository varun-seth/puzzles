    "question": "Two bullets are loaded into a gun's round barrel consecutively.
      The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot.
      Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?",
    "questionImage": "rolling_bullet.png",
    "hint": "Since the bullets are loaded consecutively, the next shot is also constrained.",
    "answer": "Yes, shuffling increases the probability of firing a bullet.",
    "solution": "
      If the two bullets are randomly put instead of consecutively, then, after firing one empty shot, there are $2$ bullets and $5$ total slots. The probability would be $2/5 = 40\\%$, but that's not the case here.\n
      Actually, the probability of firing a bullet without a shuffle is $1\/4 = 25\\%$. To understand this, imagine that the firing pin was on one of the empty slots $(3, 4, 5, 6)$, and the first shot was taken, but no bullet was fired. Now assumming that the barrel rotates clockwise, the pin will move to one of these slots: $(2, 3, 4, 5)$. Out of these four slots, only the slot $(1)$ has a bullet. Hence probability of firing a bullet is $1\/4 = 25\\%$.\n
      Note that the same is true in anti-clockwise direction.\n\n
      After the shuffle, the state is reset. There are $6$ total slots with $2$ bullets, the probabilty of firing a bullet after a shuffle is $2/6 = 1/3 \\approx 33\\% $.\n\n
      Thus, shuffling does increase the probability of firing a bullet (from $25\\%$ to $33\\%$)\n\n

    "comment":
      "This puzzle is counter-intuitive. Even today, I'm puzzled by its answer.
      In real life situations, I'd expect someone to say that since we already lost one slot, the probability of firing a bullet should increase. And nobody would question this conclusion.
      This is a good reminder to always step back and think rigorously about a problem.

    "question": "Five pirates need to divide 100 Gold Coins. Pirates have a hierarchy, from Level 1 to level 5. The highest level pirate is the leader. The leader proposes a plan to distribute the gold and all the pirates vote on it (including the leader). If at least 50% of the pirates agree on the plan, the gold is split according to the proposal. If not, level-5 pirate is kicked from the ship, and the level-4 pirate now proposes a new plan. This process continues until a proposal is accepted. All pirates are extremely smart and extremely greedy. How does level-5 Pirate divide the treasure?",
    "hint": "Here n=5, think in terms of what happens if n=1,2,3...",
    "answer": "Coin distribution is: (98, 0, 1, 0, 1) from levels (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) respectively",
    "solution": "
      Let the pirates be called P5, P4, P3, P2, P1. P5 is the leader.\n\n
      Let's study a simpler cases. So what happens if there are only 2 pirates. P2 can propose to take all the 100 gold coins. Even if P1 votes against this, P2 will vote in favor and the proposal will still be accepted (50\\% acceptance) leaving P1 with zero coins. The distribution is (100, 0) for levels (2, 1) respectively.\n\n
      Now let's look at the case with 3 pirates. P3 knows that if this proposal is not accepted, then P2 will get all the gold and P1 will get nothing. So P3 can bribe P1 with one gold coin. P1 knows that one gold coin is better than zero, and hence votes in favor of this proposal. Therefore, P3 can propose the following distribution {Level 3 pirate: 99, Level-2: 0, Level-3: 1}. Since pirate 1 and 3 will vote in favor, this proposal will be accepted. The distribution is (99, 0, 1) for levels (3, 2, 1) respectively.\n\n
      If there are 4 pirates, P4 can extend this pattern by bribing those who would get nothing in 3-pirates case, to ensure their votes. So the distribution will be (99, 0, 1, 0) for levels (4, 3, 2, 1) respectively, this will ensure that P2 will vote in favor and with the help of self voting (P4), we have 50\\% votes to accept this proposal.\n\n
      Similarly, P5 can bribe P3 and P1 pirates because they get nothing if the proposal is rejected, as P4 was giving them nothing. Hence, at level-5, the proposal is (98, 0, 1, 0, 1). This proposal will get accepted and provide the maximum amount of gold to the leader.\n\n
      PS: This puzzle gives a basic idea of game theory and dynamic programming.

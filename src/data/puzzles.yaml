    "question": "Two bullets are loaded into a gun's round barrel consecutively.
      The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot.
      Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?",
    "questionImage": "rolling_bullet.png",
    "hint": "Since the bullets are loaded consecutively, the next shot is also constrained.",
    "answer": "Yes, shuffling increases the probability of firing a bullet from $25\\%$ to $33.\\bar{3}\\%$)",
    "solution": "
      **Initial Misstep**: If the two bullets are randomly put instead of consecutively, then, after firing one empty shot, there are $2$ bullets and $5$ total slots. The probability would be $2/5 = 40\\%$, but that's not the case here.
      \n\n
      **Correct step**: The probability of firing a bullet without a shuffle is $1\/4 = 25\\%$. To understand this, imagine that the firing pin was on one of the empty slots $(3, 4, 5, 6)$, and the first shot was taken, but no bullet was fired. Now assumming that the barrel rotates clockwise, the pin will move to one of these slots: $(2, 3, 4, 5)$. Out of these four slots, only the slot $(1)$ has a bullet. Hence probability of firing a bullet is $1\/4 = 25\\%$.\n
      Note that the same is true in anti-clockwise direction.\n\n
      After the shuffle, the state is reset. There are $6$ total slots with $2$ bullets, the probabilty of firing a bullet after a shuffle is $2/6 = 1/3 \\approx 33\\% $.\n\n
      Thus, shuffling does increase the probability of firing a bullet (from $25\\%$ to $33\\%$)\n\n

    "question": "Five pirates need to divide 100 Gold Coins. Pirates have a hierarchy, from Level 1 to level 5. The highest level pirate is the leader. The leader proposes a plan to distribute the gold and all the pirates vote on it (including the leader). If at least 50% of the pirates agree on the plan, the gold is split according to the proposal. If not, level-5 pirate is kicked from the ship, and the level-4 pirate now proposes a new plan. This process continues until a proposal is accepted. All pirates are extremely smart and extremely greedy. How does level-5 Pirate divide the treasure?",
    "hint": "Here n=5, think in terms of what happens if n=1,2,3...",
    "answer": "Coin distribution is: (98, 0, 1, 0, 1) from levels (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) respectively",
    "solution": "
      Let the pirates be called P5, P4, P3, P2, P1. P5 is the leader.\n\n
      Let's study a simpler case with only 2 pirates. P2 can propose to take all the 100 gold coins. Even if P1 votes against this, P2 will vote in favor and the proposal will still be accepted (50\\% acceptance) leaving P1 with zero coins. The distribution is (100, 0) for levels (2, 1) respectively.\n\n
      Now let's look at the case with 3 pirates. P3 knows that if this proposal is not accepted, then P2 will get all the gold and P1 will get nothing. So P3 can bribe P1 with one gold coin. P1 knows that one gold coin is better than zero, and hence votes in favor of this proposal. Therefore, P3 can propose the following distribution {Level 3 pirate: 99, Level-2: 0, Level-3: 1}. Since pirate 1 and 3 will vote in favor, this proposal will be accepted. The distribution is (99, 0, 1) for levels (3, 2, 1) respectively.\n\n
      If there are 4 pirates, P4 can extend this pattern by bribing those who would get nothing in 3-pirates case, to ensure their votes. So the distribution will be (99, 0, 1, 0) for levels (4, 3, 2, 1) respectively, this will ensure that P2 will vote in favor and with the help of self voting (P4), we have 50\\% votes to accept this proposal.\n\n
      Similarly, P5 can bribe P3 and P1 pirates because they get nothing if the proposal is rejected, as P4 was giving them nothing. Hence, at level-5, the proposal is (98, 0, 1, 0, 1). This proposal will get accepted and provide the maximum amount of gold to the leader.\n\n
      PS: This puzzle gives a basic idea of game theory and dynamic programming.

    "question": "An explorer walks 1 mile south, then 1 mile East and then 1 mile North. And reaches back to the starting point. The explorer shoots a bear, what color is the bear?",
    "hint": "Earth surface is curved, not flat.",
    "answer": "White",
    "solution": "
      North-pole satisfies this condition, where moving one mile to south, east and north brings you back to the same point. And a bear living in the north pole must be a polar bear, which is white in color.\n\n
      But North pole is not the only point on Earth to satisfy this. How many such points are there?
      Consider this, if movement towards East (1 mile) was not there, then the explorer would have reached the starting point no matter what. But, since we are consider such an extreme case (north pole), let's take one more step. Imagine if 1 mile was the circumference of the circle, then the explorer would have reached the starting point by moving East.\n\n
      Can this happen in real life - Yes!\n\n
      We can imagine a ring of size 1 mile near the south pole, about $1\/(2 \\pi)$ miles away from it. The radius of this ring is such that the circumference will be exactly 1 mile.
      If the explorer could start from 1 mile north of this ring, then they would have reached the starting point after moving 1 mile south, 1 mile east (entire ring) and 1 mile north.\n\n
      Hence, any point located at approximately $1 + 1\/(2 \\pi) $ miles away from the south pole satisfies the condition.
      Hence there are infinite such points, the locus is a ring near the south pole.

Since neither of these 2 women know that their husbands are cheaters, they both do not report their husbands in on the day of the announcement.

Since 1024 > 1000, it's actually possible for some scheme to work. \n\nHere's the scheme: The king assigns each servant a number from 1-10. The king assigns each bottle a number from 0-999.

Make the corresponding prisoner drink small quantitiy of that wine. (ie prisoner 1 takes a sip of wine #1). Continue this process upto 1000th wine. After 3 weeks, suppose only prisoner number 4 & 7 die. This means the binary representation of poisoned wine has '1' at position 4 & 7, and rest all zeros.

He suggests a new salary plan for every person including himself in front of the city. Citizens are greedy, and vote yes if their salary is raised, no if decreased, and don''t vote otherwise.

    "question": "At a party of $N \\ge 2$ people, there are some friendships.
      Prove that there are at-least two people with the same count of friends.\n\n
      Assume that the friendships are symmetric, i.e, if $A$ is friends with $B$, then $B$ is in turn friends with $A$. ",
    "hint": "Pigeonhole Principle",
    "answer": "Since there are $N-1$ possibilities for friend-count and total $N$ people, atleast two people must have the same count.",
    "solution": "
      The question can be solved by using the Pigeonhole Principle, which essentially states that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with more than one pigeon.\n\n

      In this party of $N$ people, indexed from $1$ to $N$. The maximum number of friends a person can have is $N-1$, because one can be friends with every other person but not with oneself. So the possible number of friends one can have ranges from $0$ to $N-1$, a total of $N$ possibilities.\n\n

      Note: If someone has zero friends, then someone else can have atmost $N-2$ friends, alternatively if someone has $N-1$ friends then someone else must have at-least $1$ friends.\n\n

      Hence, the total possibilities of the count of friends ranges from $0$ to $N-2$ or from $1$ to $N-1$, i.e, total $N-1$ possibilities, but there are only $N$ people at the party. \n\n

      Let's consider the count of friends as \"pigeonholes\" and people as \"pigeons\". Notice that there are $N$ people (\"pigeons\") and $N - 1$ different count of friends (\"pigeonholes\").\n\n

      So, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two people must have the same count of friends in the party of $N$ people.\n\n

      There's another way to solve this.\n\n

      **Proof by Contradiction**:
      Assume that every person has a different number of friends from $0$ to $N - 1$.
      We would have a situation where one person has $0$ friends and another person has $N-1$ friends. This, however, contradicts the premise that friendships are symmetric, because if one person has $N-1$ friends, there cannot be someone with $0$ friends. Hence not everyone has a different number of friends

    "hint": "If the polygon contains the center, the longest distance between any two points on the circumference will be less than $\\pi$.",
    "answer": "$1- nP$ where $P = 1/{2^{n-1}}$",
    "question": "N points are chosen at random on the circumference of a circle. A convex $n$-gon (n sided polygon) is drawn by joining these n points. What is the probability that the center of circle lies inside the region of $n$-gon?",
    "solution": "
      In order for a polygon inscribed in a circle to exclude the center of that circle, there must be a straight line that can be drawn through the center of the circle such that all vertices (points) of the polygon are on one side of that line. In terms of the circle, this line is a diameter, and all the points are within a semi-circle.
      Thus, the polygon excludes the center __if and only if__ all points are within a semi-circle. This is easier to check.\n\n

      Suppose we consider the first point (at random), imagine a semi-circle arc that starts from this point, towards clockwise direction around the circle. We want to know if the next $n-1$ points lie on this semi-circle.
      Since the probability of each next point is uniformly random along the entire circumference, the probability is $1/2$ that each point lies within this imaginary semi-circle. Thus, the probability that all those $n-1$ points lie on this semi-circle is $P = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2}    \\cdot ... \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} =\\dfrac1{2^{n-1}}$.\n\n

      But, it is not necessary that all the points lie within the semi-circle started from the first point. It is true that if the polygon excludes the center, then certainly all points are within some semi-circle, but which one? Let us define the semi-circle as an arc that starts from some point of the polygon towards clockwise direction. This definition ensures that only one such semi-circle can exist.
      Suppose $X_i = 1$ if the semi-circle starting from point $i$ contains all the other points, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.
      Then, $P(X_1 = 1) = P$.\n\n

      Note that the probability of this event is identical for each $i$, because when we observe the semi-circle strating from the $i$th point, all the other $n-1$ points are just random points on the circumference, hence $P(X_1 = 1) = P(X_i = 1) = P(X_n = 1) = P$.
      \n\n

      We want to know the probability that any one of those start-points satisfy the condition, i.e. $P(X_1 = 1 \\cup X_2 = 1 \\cup ... \\cup X_n = 1)$.
      \n\n
      Note that if any one $X_k$ is $1$, then all other $X_i$'s are $0$. This is because of the way we defined our semi-circle to start from one of the points. If we start the semi-circle for any other point $i \\ne k$, then the $k^{th}$ point lies outside the semi-circle, i.e, and $X_{i\\ne k} = 0$.
      Hence, by definition, $(X_i = 1)$'s are disjoint events, and hence the probability of union is sum of individual probabilities.
      \n\n
      Thus, probability of center-exclusion = $P(X_1 = 1 \\cup X_2 = 1 \\cup ... \\cup X_n = 1) = P(X_1 = 1) + ... + P(X_n = 1) = n * P$
      \n\n
      Hence the probability that the polygon includes the center of the circle is $1 - nP$ where $P = \\dfrac{1}{2^{n-1}}$

(*Later)\n\nSo, T(n) = T(n\/2) + O(log n)\nT(n) = O(log^2 n).\nTo be exact, this is k*(k+1)\/2 . where k = log N\n\n(*Sub-Algorithm)\nDivide the set into two sets A and B of equal number of coins. Let A greater than B and to make both side of equal weight, I need to shift few coins from A to B and equal number of coins from B to A. So divide A into A1 and A2, and B into B1 and B2. Move A2 from A into B and B1 from B into A now if (A1,B1) is greater than (B2,A2) then I have not moved enough coins from A into B so as to make B part heavy enough hence you divide A1 into A11,A12 and move A12 in B side similarly u move B21 into A side on the other hand if (A1,B1) is less than (A2,B2) I have more than enough coins from A into B hence move B12 back into B and A21 back into A now measure again. Do it so on...\n\nNote that we are doing this in O(log n) as each time the number of coins we are moving is reduced by half. So, In O(log n), we are done.\n\nTo prove that solution always exists, we do it by induction:\ndifference in the number of heavy coin after kth iteration cannot be more than 2^(n-1-k)\nSo, after n-1th iteration, it can be more that 1 coin. Hence, done. :)",

So, if we choose w_i = (2k+1)^{i-1}, i=1...p, then everything till k*((2k+1)^p - 1)\/((2k+1)-1) = ((2k+1)^p-1)\/2 can be weighted, thus requiring p=log_{2k+1} (2N+1) number of distinct weights.",

Note that the probability that I add the card above the red card, when x-1 is the number of cards above red and y-1 is the number of cards below red is x\/(x+y). Let the problem be: if red card is dividing the black cards into two sets, what is the expected number of black cards in the smaller section. So, we see that the two problems are equivalent.\n\nNow this way, we are getting all possible combinations in which one red and n black cards can be mixed, we see that the probability that the red card is at height h is independent of h.

    "question": 'You are given an urn with 100 balls (50 black and 50 white). You pick balls from urn one by one without replacements until all the balls are out. A black followed by a white or a white followed by a black is "a colour change". Calculate the expected number of colour-changes if the balls are being picked randomly from the urn.',
    "hint": "Linearity of expectation",
    "answer": "50",
    "solution": "
      Each time we draw, there could be a possible color-switch, except the first time we draw, hence 99 possible switches.\n\n
      Let $X_i$ be a random variable taking value 1 if $i_{th}$ position has a colour change and zero otherwise, note that $i$ goes from $1$ to $99$.\n\n
      Total number of changes, $S = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{99} = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} X_i$\n\n
      The expected number of color changes is denoted by the sum of these variables, i.e $E[S] = E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{99}]$\n\n
      Linearity of expectation states that the expected value of the sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expected values.\n\n
      Hence the answer is $E[S] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_{99}]$ \n\n
      Note that each $X_i$ is identical, and the expected value is equal for each $i$, i.e, $E(X_k) = E(X_1) $\n\n
      Hence $E[S] = E[X_1] + ... + E[X_n] = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} E[X_1] = 99 * E[X_1] $\n\n
      Also, we can calculate the expected value, $E[X_1] = 1 * P(X_1 = 1) + 0 * P(X_1 = 0) = P(X_1 =1) $\n\n
      Probability of any given color change is (either first is R second is B, or first is B and second is R)
      $= P(X_1 = 1)= \\dfrac{50}{100}*\\dfrac{50}{99} + \\dfrac{50}{100}*\\dfrac{50}{99} = 50\/99$\n\n
      Finally, the answer is $ E[S] = \\sum_{i=1}^{99} E[X_i] = 99 * E[X_1] = 99 * 50/99 = 50$

    "question": "Two bullets are loaded into a gun's round barrel consecutively.
      The barrel has a capacity of 6. The gun is fired once, but no bullet is shot.
      Does rolling the barrel (shuffling) before next shot increase the probability of firing a bullet?",
    "questionImage": "rolling_bullet.png",
    "hint": "Since the bullets are loaded consecutively, the next shot is also constrained.",
    "answer": "Yes, shuffling increases the probability of firing a bullet.",
    "solution": "
      If the two bullets are randomly put instead of consecutively, then, after firing one empty shot, there are $2$ bullets and $5$ total slots. The probability would be $2/5 = 40\\%$, but that's not the case here.\n
      Actually, the probability of firing a bullet without a shuffle is $1\/4 = 25\\%$. To understand this, imagine that the firing pin was on one of the empty slots $(3, 4, 5, 6)$, and the first shot was taken, but no bullet was fired. Now assumming that the barrel rotates clockwise, the pin will move to one of these slots: $(2, 3, 4, 5)$. Out of these four slots, only the slot $(1)$ has a bullet. Hence probability of firing a bullet is $1\/4 = 25\\%$.\n
      Note that the same is true in anti-clockwise direction.\n\n
      After the shuffle, the state is reset. There are $6$ total slots with $2$ bullets, the probabilty of firing a bullet after a shuffle is $2/6 = 1/3 \\approx 33\\% $.\n\n
      Thus, shuffling does increase the probability of firing a bullet (from $25\\%$ to $33\\%$)\n\n

    "comment":
      "This puzzle is counter-intuitive. Even today, I'm puzzled by its answer.
      In real life situations, I'd expect someone to say that since we already lost one slot, the probability of firing a bullet should increase. And nobody would question this conclusion.
      This is a good reminder to always step back and think rigorously about a problem.

    "question": "Five pirates need to divide 100 Gold Coins. Pirates have hierarchy, from Level 5 to level 1. The level-5 pirate proposes a division plan and all the pirates vote on it. If at least 50% of the pirates agree on the plan, the gold is split according to the proposal. If not, level-5 pirate is kicked from the ship, and the level-4 pirate now proposes a plan. This process continues until a proposal is accepted. All pirates are extremely smart and extremely greedy. How does level-5 Pirate divide the treasure?",
    "hint": "Here n=5, think in terms of what happens if n=1,2,3...",
    "answer": "Division is: 98,0,1,0,1",
    "solution": "To understand the answer, \
      we need to reduce this problem to only 2 pirates. So what happens if there are only 2 pirates. Pirate 2 can easily propose that he gets all the 100 gold coins. Since he constitutes 50% of the pirates, the proposal has to be accepted leaving Pirate 1 with nothing.\n\nNow let's look at 3 pirates situation, Pirate 3 knows that if his proposal does not get accepted, then pirate 2 will get all the gold and pirate 1 will get nothing. So he decides to bribe pirate 1 with one gold coin. Pirate 1 knows that one gold coin is better than nothing so he has to back pirate 3. Pirate 3 proposes {pirate 1, pirate 2, pirate 3} {1, 0, 99}. Since pirate 1 and 3 will vote for it, it will be accepted.\n\nIf there are 4 pirates, pirate 4 needs to get one more pirate to vote for his proposal. Pirate 4 realizes that if he dies, pirate 2 will get nothing (according to the proposal with 3 pirates) so he can easily bribe pirate 2 with one gold coin to get his vote. So the distribution will be {0, 1, 0, 99}.\n\nSmart right? Now can you figure out the distribution with 5 pirates? Let's see. Pirate 5 needs 2 votes and he knows that if he dies, pirate 1 and 3 will get nothing. He can easily bribe pirates 1 and 3 with one gold coin each to get their vote. In the end, he proposes {1, 0, 1, 0, 98}. This proposal will get accepted and provide the maximum amount of gold to pirate 5.\n\nPS:This puzzle gives a basic idea of game theory and dynamic programming. ",
